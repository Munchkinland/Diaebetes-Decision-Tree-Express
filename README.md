âœ…Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measures. The dataset comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

This is an express classifier without Descriptive Analysis neither EDA nor Diagnostic

âœ…Hypothesis

We hypothesize that certain values or combinations of values in the variables (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age) may be associated with an increased risk of diabetes. We will perform statistical analyses, such as regressions and significance tests, to evaluate the associations between these variables and the outcome variable (Outcome).

The project focuses on building a decision tree classifier using the Scikit-learn library in Python. Here's a summary of the key steps and the purpose of the project:

âœ…Project Objective:

Diabetes Prediction: The project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measures.
Project Steps:

âœ…Data Ingestion:

A diabetes dataset is loaded from an external link and stored locally.

âœ…Feature Selection:

Relevant features such as 'Pregnancies,' 'Glucose,' 'BloodPressure,' among others, are chosen, and the dataset is split into training and test sets.

âœ…Building Decision Tree Model:

A decision tree classifier is created and trained with the training set.

âœ…Save Model:

The trained model is saved to a file using the pickle library.

âœ…Evaluate Model:

The model's accuracy is evaluated using the test set.

âœ…Visualizing Decision Tree:

The generated decision tree is visualized and saved as an image.

âœ…Optimizing Decision Tree Performance:

A new decision tree classifier with specific parameters is created to improve performance, and its accuracy is evaluated.

âœ…Save Optimized Model:

The optimized model is saved to a file using pickle.

âœ…Load Model:

The trained and optimized models are loaded for further use.

âœ…Generate requirements.txt:

A requirements.txt file is generated containing project dependencies so that others can replicate the development environment.
In summary, the project addresses the construction of a decision tree classifier for diabetes prediction, covering data loading, model training, evaluation, and optimization steps. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive set of steps and tools to address similar classification problems in the future.

Disclaimer ðŸ‘‰ There is just a quick sight, an express interpretation, of course it could be performance better.
